1. Choose the right answer. (10 points)

\vspace{10pt}

i). A state is called \hspace{30pt} state if, once the chains enters the state, it remains there forever

(a) null recurrent (b) limiting (c) stationary (d) absorbing

ii). A \hspace{30pt} distribution doesnâ€™t change over time under the Markov process.

(a) transient (b) stationary (c) initial (d) None of them

iii). A stationary distribution is a probability distribution over the states of a Markov chain such that, if the chain \hspace{30pt} in it, it will remain in it all future time steps.

(a) stuck (b) starts (c) end (d) none of these 

iv). The transient distribution describes the probability distribution of the states at a particular\hspace{30pt} time step.

(a) Infinite (b) finite (c) one (d) none of these 

v). Limiting distribution exists if a Markov chain is irreducible, positive recurrent, and\hspace{30pt}

(a) periodic (b) has absorbing states (c) aperiodic (d) None of these

\vspace{10pt}

2. Mark each statement as True or False. (10 points)

\vspace{10pt}

i). A limiting distribution of the Markov chain converges as time goes to infinity, regardless of the starting distribution.

(a) True (b) False

ii). Each column of any transition matrix ($P$) should sum to $1$.

(a) True (b) False 

iii). A finite set of possible states, often represented as {1, 2, ...}. 

(a) True (b) False 

iv). A positive recurrent state has an infinite expected time to return.

(a) True (b) False 

v). For a discrete Markov Chain, the initial distribution is a probability distribution over states at time $n$=0.

(a) True (b) False 

\vspace{10pt}

3. Draw a Transition diagram for the following matrix and identify the transient, recurrent, and absorbing states in it. (10 points)

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0.4 & 0.3 & 0.3 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 \\
0.5 & 0.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.3 & 0.0 & 0.3 & 0.4
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\vspace{10pt}

\vspace{800pt}

4. Consider a website with 3 different types of pages: $\{A: Home, B:Articles, C:PDF\}$, the Home page has a link to the Articles page and Articles page has a link back to Home page. Then the Article page has hyperlinks to published articles, clicking any of the hyperlinks opens a PDF document. When the user clicks the hyperlinks it opens the PDF version of the published article, which does not have any links to the previous pages. (30 points)

\[
P=
\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0\\
0.5 & 0 & 0.5\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{array} } \right]
\]

When the user initially opens the website, page $A$ is displayed on the screen

\vspace{10pt}

i). Find the periods of all the states and check if the chain is periodic or aperiodic. (6)

\vspace{1500pt}

ii). Find the expected return time to page $A$. (6)

\vspace{1500pt}

iii). Find out the absorbing states of the Markov chain and calculate the absorbing probabilities.(6)

\vspace{1500pt}

iv). Find out if the chain is positive or null-recurrent. (6)

\vspace{1500pt}

v). Findout the stationary distribution if exist. (6)

\vspace{1000pt}

5. Suppose voter preferences for Democrat(D) party, Republican(R) party, and Independents(I) candidates shift around randomly via the transition matrix $P$. If in a previous election, party D got 48\% votes, party R got 42\% votes and party I got 10\% votes out of the total votes cast. (40 points)

i). Predict the percentage of all the parties' votes distributed during the upcoming election. (6)

\vspace{1000pt}

ii). Check if the limiting distribution for the above Markov Chain exists? (10)

\vspace{1000pt}

iii). If the answer to (ii) is yes, then find the limiting distribution of the above Markov Chain. (8)

\vspace{1000pt}

iv). Does a limiting distribution mean voters stopped switching parties or the overall proportions of voters are stabilized after many election cycles? (6)

\vspace{1000pt}

v). Check if the chain is ergodic? (10)


\vspace{1000pt}


\textbf{Important Formulas}

i). Absorption probabilities

lets $a_i$=P(absorption in a $\mid$ $X_0$=i), where i $\in S$

\[
a_{i} = \sum_{k \in S} a_{k} \cdot P_{ik}
\]
ii) Mean hitting time

\[
h_{ki} = 1+\sum_{k \in S} P_{kj} \cdot h_{ji}, k \ne i
\]

ii) Mean return time 

\[
r_{i} = 1+\sum_{k \in S} P_{ik} \cdot h_{ki}
\]
